<!-- in View we create an instance Vue which is the heart of the application, 
     plugs to an elment in the dom , and that element uses an expression to 
 display that instance's data-->

<!-- 
     In this leason I have learnt the following:
     Attribute binding
        - Use v-bind:src ="property value" or for short use :src="property value"
     Condtional rendering
        -v-if if we have to toggle between two options to show something or not show. Other alterntive is to use v-show
        -v-else-if
        -v-else
     List rendering
         use the directive v-for
    Iterating Over Objects

    Class & style Binding
        - In this file, instead of using text for various product colors when user hover over text. Instead I will use class and style binding and change color text to little boxes to indicate color
        How do I include multiple styles in one class?
    Computed Properties
        - Render a computed value instead of just a value to an element in the dom using computed option and create computed property, this 
        allows to update the h1 value autmoaticaly if either product, or brand properties change
    Components
        - are re-usable building blocks that has structure and function. It consists of a name and option objects, inside of a componant we find
            template
            data as a function
            methods
            computed values
        - props are variables that are filled with data from the parent down to its child component, so that whenever a compnenets trys to access information or a porperty from a parent
          props play as the filter to transfer that data... 
    Communication Events
        - to connect an event to a component, first we need to defin an event in the compnonat under methods by giving adding the $emit inside the function and also giving it a name
        -then adding an event listener in the <product> component inside html file as follows @name-of-event and sign it to the approprite from the instance method
